<p>I really enjoy the “manual-ness” of Linux, in the same way that driving stick-shift gives you finer control of the vehicle, or the way that riding a fixed gear bicycle gives you a feel for how your bike is making contact with the road. I was on my work laptop, and my screen was too bright. It’s late at night and I want to shift it towards a yellow tint. Remove the blue lights and your sleep will be better, they say.</p>

<p>Two commands! That’s all it took to accomplish the task.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pacman -S redshift
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This installs the open source program, redshift. Go ahead, feast your eyes on its magnificent code: https://github.com/jonls/redshift
It’s a wonderful program which lets you control the tint of your screen.</p>

<p>The second command sets the screen to something akin to candle light, or a color temperature of 3400K. That brings me to my next command, in which I specified that exact color temperature:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">redshift -o 3400</code></p>

<p>Wonderful! My screen was now at a perfect color temperature for coding in the evening.</p>

<p>Except… the screen is too bright.</p>

<p>I need to invoke the xbacklight command. It adjusts my screen brightness.</p>

<p>I use i3 as a window manager, which means that I had to manually add these to the configuration:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bindsym XF86MonBrightnessUp exec --no-startup-id xbacklight -inc 2
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessDown exec --no-startup-id xbacklight -dec 2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This binds my keyboard’s backlight buttons, so that they issue commands to the xbacklight utility and either increase or decrease the backlight by 2%.</p>

<p>At this point I wouldn’t blame you for saying to yourself, “What a pain in the ass. Who bothers to map their keyboard keys to their favorite screen brightness utility?”</p>

<p>But I say to you, this is a most beautiful way to meld with your operating system. Linux can be a wonderfully sparse toolset, and a blank canvas on which to develop your aesthetics.</p>

<p>If this piqued your interest and you’d like to discuss it further, please get at me via twitter @mrashkovsky or email (same handle, @gmail.com).</p>
